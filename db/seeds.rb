    bio: 'I opened my first practice in the Medical Arts Building at Northwest Hospital.  I practiced there over a year before moving to my current office at 7201 5th Avenue NE.
    While at Northwest, I was invited by Bill Turska N.D. in Mist, Oregon to come and help him.  He was my first mentor.  He was an old-timey Naturopath that had a history of incredible cures.  I would work with him on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, and at my practice in Seattle on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.  One night when we had finished working with clients, Dr. Turska and I stayed up and talked for a long time into the night.  When I woke up the next morning, I felt different, like I was no longer a young Doc working with a mentor but two colleagues working together.  It wasn\'t his words to me, it was something else.  He would talk about how he worked on patients through the ethers, and I think he worked on me.',

      bio: 'One day while I was walking across campus, a friend called to me.  She handed me a paper with the name "John Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine" written on it.  I felt a flash like lightening and shouted, "That\'s it, I\'m going to be a Naturopathic doctor!  I\'m grateful to her everyday for that note. I finished my Biology/ Pre-med, interviewed at John Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine and was accepted.  Also, I joined the U.S. Army as a medic which helped pay the way to fulfill my dream. I went to school with a great group of people at John Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine.  We worked hard, studied hard, and supported each other to get through the program and graduate. I\'m proud of my class, as they have truly contributed to the advancement of Naturopathic medicine, and still do. The year we graduated the college name changed to Bastyr University.',

Following residency in Emergency Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, he completed additional training in Pediatrics, Pediatric Emergency Medicine and Pediatric Critical Care at The Children\'s Hospital, Boston. While at Harvard, Dr. Dellitalia`s research training focused upon novel means for the mechanical support of lung injury and for restoring lost control of regional pulmonary blood flow. Upon returning to the University of Virginia as PCCM Faculty, Dr. Dellitalia began to explore erythrocyte-based control of regional blood flow and made the observation that this signaling is disrupted in severe inflammatory states. This observation suggested the hypothesis that acquired injury to erythrocytes alters vascular control, regional blood flow regulation and O2 delivery homeostasis; the Dellitalia Lab pursues this question.',
